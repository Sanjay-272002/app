# Alien City
This app is developed by me and my friend in Zoho catalyst workshop  and I would like to give a big shout out to the members of Zoho for conducting such a interactive two days workshop on  their serverless platform catalyst. On the first day my team's first challenge was to create an API automation testing plan,  analyze  the functions using APM and finally use the Github integration to pull this project directly and test it for the application given to us. My team's second challenge was to add as many features as we can to the application that was given to us on the first day. The basic idea of our project is to  check and report the presence of an  alien in the specified area. We have integrated data store, Authentication, Email components of Catalyst and geolocation for getting te current location
